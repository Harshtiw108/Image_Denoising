Introduction
Low-light image enhancement is a crucial task in computer vision, aiming to improve the quality of images taken in poor lighting conditions. This project leverages a CNN model to enhance low-light images by learning the mapping from low-light images to their enhanced versions.

notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration and experimentation.
README.md: This README file.
requirements.txt: Required Python packages.
Setup Instructions
Clone the repository:

sh
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/low-light-image-enhancement.git
cd low-light-image-enhancement
Set up a virtual environment:

sh
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install the required packages:

sh
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Mount Google Drive (if using Google Colab):

python
Copy code
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')
Data Preparation
Load your data:

Ensure your datasets are stored in the appropriate directories (data/train/low_light, data/train/enhanced, data/val/low_light, data/val/enhanced).
Convert lists to numpy arrays (if needed):

python
Copy code
import numpy as np
low_light_images_list = np.load('/path/to/low_light_images.npy', allow_pickle=True)
enhanced_images_list = np.load('/path/to/enhanced_images.npy', allow_pickle=True)
low_light_images = np.array(low_light_images_list)
enhanced_images = np.array(enhanced_images_list)
Training the Model
Run the training script:

sh
Copy code
python src/train.py
This script will train the CNN model using the specified dataset and hyperparameters. Gradient accumulation is implemented to handle larger batch sizes.

Evaluation
Evaluate the model:

sh
Copy code
python src/evaluate.py
This script will evaluate the model's performance using the Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) metric on the validation dataset.

Usage
Enhance a new image:

Use the trained model to enhance new low-light images. Ensure the model is loaded correctly and process the images as follows:

python
Copy code
from src.model import build_enhanced_model
import numpy as np
import cv2

# Load the model
model = build_enhanced_model(input_shape)
model.load_weights('path/to/model/weights')

# Load and preprocess the low-light image
low_light_image = cv2.imread('path/to/low_light_image.png')
low_light_image = low_light_image / 255.0
low_light_image = np.expand_dims(low_light_image, axis=0)

# Enhance the image
enhanced_image = model.predict(low_light_image)
enhanced_image = np.squeeze(enhanced_image, axis=0)

# Save the enhanced image
cv2.imwrite('path/to/enhanced_image.png', enhanced_image * 255)
